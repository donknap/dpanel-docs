# Pro Edition

### Preface

DPanel will continue to be a community-focused platform. The Pro and Community versions are not in conflict with each other; rather, they contribute to the community and ensure the long-term viability of the project.

The Pro version is a derivative of the Community version, sharing most of the code. The Professional version builds upon the Community version with customized functional modules (the code is located in the app/pro directory). You don't need to worry about security vulnerabilities caused by invisible code.

The Pro version merely enhances and supplements the Community version. Common, broadly based functional requirements will not be included in the Pro version. We will only enhance and upgrade some of the Community version's features, or address highly customized needs.

Thank you for your support and love.

### Purchase Notice

- The Pro edition is fully compatible with the Community edition; the difference lies in the use of different images. After purchasing the Pro edition, simply place the license file in the /dpanel directory of the panel and rebuild the panel container using the Pro edition image.
- The Pro edition version number will remain synchronized with the Community edition. The release of a new version does not necessarily mean that the Pro edition has new features.
- During the Pro edition license period, you can use the features and upgrade the version an unlimited number of times.
- The Pro edition license certificate supports offline use, but please ensure that you do not redistribute or share it. Otherwise, your rights will be forfeited and no refund will be given.

### Pricing and Features

:::tip Pro edition is 99 RMB/year. [Support and Purchase](https://afdian.com/item/56df0a88d6dd11efa8bc5254001e7c00)
