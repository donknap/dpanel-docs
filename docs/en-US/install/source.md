# Run with binary

:::tip 
Running DPanel via the binary package is equivalent to the Lite Edition, which does not include features like domain forwarding.

We recommend using a container to create DPanel for greater compatibility.

## Run

> Run configuration to modify config.yaml
> When running the program, specify the environment variable value defined in config.yaml

When running DPanel via binary, it will automatically connect to the current default Docker engine.
In Linux, it is /var/run/docker.sock, and in Windows, it is //./pipe/docker_engine.

::: code-group

```shell [Linux]
chmod 755 ./runtime/dpanel
./runtime/dpanel server:start -f config.yaml
```

```shell [Window]
 .\dpanel.exe server:start -f .\config.yaml
```

## Docker is not installed on the system

If Docker is not installed on system, after starting the DPanel, you can configure the default remote Docker server through [Multiple Environment Management](/manual/system-env).

### Install docker-cli command

DPanel depends on docker and docker compose (docker-compose) commands.
If you don't have docker engine installed, you need to install these client command components manually, according to the system you use [add Docker software source](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/).

Install the docker-cli client command component.

:::code-group
```shell [Debian]
sudo apt install docker-ce-cli docker-compose-plugin
```
